Today, I went to see Dr. Abc, he suggested me to do yoga. So you think you have nothing to hide…think again. If you truly don’t see the value in keeping your data private, consider this: Post all your credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, medical records and text messages on Facebook.

Are you willing to do this? Probably not.

But if you aren’t careful or are targeted by a hacker or another malicious actor, this could happen. Your data could be stolen and posted publicly on the internet, despite your own objection. The problem with privacy is that people don’t see its value until they lose control of their personal data, and then it’s too late.

Until there is some light
Keep your hopes up and bright

Be happy, it's your right
Even if you have to fight
